## What areas of the app did you focus on?

I focused more on the Architecture side of the app. I have used retrofit for API calling and Dagger for dependency injection. I have used the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture to develop my Android application.
I also worked on UI part of the Application, to develop a simple UI to cover all the aspects of the given requirements.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

## How long did you spend on this project?

I spent around 6 hours for the development of this project.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

I did not use the Reactive Programming for API calls. I wanted to work on implementing the RxKotlin along with the Retrofit so that this application could support asynchronous events using observables and easily compose complex asynchronous workflows.
If I had more time to implement the project, I would have spent it on implementing the Reactive Programming.

I also wanted to try using the Jetpack compose to develop the UI of this application using declarative functions.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I faced some difficulties while implementing the Dagger for Dependency injection. So I believe that was the weak part for my project, as I had to spend a considerable amount of time to resolve the initial issue that I face while setting up the Dagger.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!

I used the basic layout for the cardview of the Employee list from my Previous Project that I developed for the Subject "Mobile Computing" while studying at Arizona State University.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
