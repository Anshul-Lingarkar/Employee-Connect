## What areas of the app did you focus on?

I focused more on the Architecture side of the app. I have used retrofit for API calling and Dagger for dependency injection. I have used the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture to develop my Android application.
I also worked on UI part of the Application, to develop a simple UI to cover all the aspects of the given requirements.

During the development process, my primary focus was on working on the architecutre of the application. Key areas that I considered includes:

1. App Architecture: I used the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture my application. I also used Dagger for efficient dependency injection, ensuring modularity and scalability.
2. API Integration: I utilized Retrofit for API calls to enhance the app's connectivity and responsiveness. By implementing this robust framework, helped me with seamless call to the given endpoints.
3. User Interface Design: I also worked to refine the user interface (UI) design. I selected a simple UI covering all the requirements given for this task.

These areas of focus were addressed to ensure the development of a robust and efficient Android application.


## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

While working at HSBC, I had also worked as a Team leader for developing one of the feature for the HSBC Bank's android app. While working as Team leader I worked majorly on developing the Architecture for the feature, and so this was the main reason for my focus in the development of this Application.


## How long did you spend on this project?

I spent around 6 hours for the development of this project. 
I had distributed my work over 4 days, where I worked on UI and basic setup, adding logo for the app on Day 1.
Then I worked on using the Retrofit for API call, handlnig unnecessary API call while rotating the phone screen, pull-to-refresh part and adding the employee photos, along with Basic UI testing of the App on Day 2.
On Day 3, I worked on setting up the Dagger.
On Day 4, I worked on error handling part and handling the other two provided endpoints - empty and malformed employees and then writing unit tests and overall testing of the app to check that it covers all the given requirements.


## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

I did not use the Reactive Programming (RxKotlin) for API calls along with the Retrofit. I wanted to work on implementing the RxKotlin along with the Retrofit so that this application could support asynchronous events using observables and easily compose complex asynchronous workflows.
If I had more time to implement the project, I would have spent it on implementing the Reactive Programming.

I also wanted to try using the Jetpack compose to develop the UI of this application using declarative functions.


## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I faced some difficulties while implementing the Dagger for Dependency injection. So I believe that was the weak part for my project, as I had to spend a considerable amount of time to resolve the issue that I face while setting up the Dagger.


## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!

I used the basic layout for the cardview of the RecyclerView list from my Previous Project that I developed for the Subject "Mobile Computing" while studying at Arizona State University. It was individual project, so I had develop the UI for the View, while I was working on the Project.


## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?

I have also hosted this project on my private repository and this is the link for this project on GitHub - https://github.com/Anshul-Lingarkar/Employee-Connect
